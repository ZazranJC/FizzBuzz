# FizzBuzz

This is a simple java game that I recreated called "FizzBuzz"
It takes numberical user inputs and later checks if it is divisible by 3 or 5.
Simple conditions here are,
If the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 it will return FizzBuzz. 
If it is divisible by only 5 it will return Fizz
If the number is divisible by 3 only it will return Buzz
Otherwise for all other cases it will return the user input.

This is a simple calculator designed to only calculate if the user input is divisible by 3 or 5 or both to display simple understanding about problem solving abilitles.
